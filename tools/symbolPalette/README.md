## Symbol palette

The symbol palette is a grid of symbols and has 2 arguments:
* |$input| - required and a jQuery object. This is the input element that the symbol palette is to be associated with.
* |symbols| - required and an array of strings, e.g. ['¬', '∧', '∨'].

The |symbols| are converted into a grid and displayed when the user focuses on the input element.

See the tool templateSymbolPalette for an example.
